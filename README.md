# BandLibrary
Django-based music library manager

Our brass band used to store its library index in a spreadsheet. 
This new system replaces that, and can handle scans of front sheets so we can see what obscure music looks like.

As requirements refine, we'll add new features.

One feature is that guest users don't get to see the call no (index code) for an item. You can see an item but not where it is.

It's quite mobile friendly, as far as a catalogue can be.

There's a stack of favicon images created by http://realfavicongenerator.net/ which are our logo. If you use this code, you should change them.
